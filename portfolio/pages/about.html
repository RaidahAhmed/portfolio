                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Raidah, a curious mind exploring the world of technology and creativity. I enjoy mastering new skills and applying them to solve problems creatively and effectively. My journey has led me to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C#, Java, along with Data Analysis and Graphic design, giving me a versatile foundation in both coding and design. <br> I thrive on building projects that challenge me to think critically, from responsive websites to small applications and data driven solutions. I approach every project with curiosity, attention to detail, and a desire to grow_always looking for ways technology can make life simpler and more connected. <br> Learning and discovery motivate me, and I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skills, explore new ideas and turn them into meaningful and practical outcomes.
